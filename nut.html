<h1>The nut kernel</h1>

<p>Nut is a simple small kernel to make powerfull operative systems. Nut is made in C/C++, ASM, Makefile, NutScript and YACC &amp; LEX for the NutScript interpreter. Nut has got many different modules, from I/O to FAT32 file system implementation.</p>

<h3>Getting nut</h3>

<p>If you want to get the nut kernel, you have 2 options, get the built kernel in the <a href="https://github.com/HdbSoft/nut/releases">releases directory</a> as a <em>.zip</em> file or build it by yourself. You can also get pre-compiled binaries from our <a href="https://github.com/HdbSoft/nut-bins">nut bins repository</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to build nut from source code, you first need to clone the repository into your machine:
<code>bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HdbSoft/nut.git nut
$ cd nut/
</code></p>

<h4>Building nut</h4>

<p>If you don't want to build nut by using cross-compiling, you just need to use run this command replacing YOUR-ARCH by your architecture:
<code>bash
$ make ARCH=YOUR-ARCHITECTURE
</code>
by default, nut Makefile uses <strong>x86</strong> as target architecture.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you haven't build nut before, you will need to make with the EXISTS-NUT-INCLUDE as no:\
<code>$ make EXISTS-NUT-INCLUDE=no</code></p>

<p>If you haven't got the necessary tools to build nut, you can install them by running your OS's nut setup file:\
<code>$ ./setup/setup.YOUR-OS.sh</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also cross-compile nut, by setting the CC variable by your cross compiler and the ASSEMBLER variable by your cross assembler. For example, if you want to cross-compile nut from x86 to ARM32, you can run this:
<code>bash
$ make "CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc" "ASSEMBLER=arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-a7 -fpic -ffreestanding -c" ARCH=ARM32
</code></p>

<p>or if you want to build nut for Sun SPARC, you can run this command:
<code>bash
$ make CC=sparc-elf-gcc ASSEMBLER=sparc-elf-as ARCH=SPARC
</code></p>

<p>you can also build nut for MOS 6502 (by now is unstable):
<code>bash
$ make CC=cc65 ASSEMBLER=cl65 ARCH=6502
</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> cross compilers are not included in nut's setup scripts, if you want to cross compile, you will need to get them by yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can just build the kernel or the bootfile by running the <code>kernel</code> or the <code>bootfile</code> recipe.</p>

<h6>Available architectures list</h6>

<ul>
<li><strong>x86</strong></li>
<li><strong>ARM</strong></li>
<li><strong>ARM32</strong></li>
<li><strong>RISC-V</strong></li>
<li><strong>6502</strong></li>
<li><strong>raspberrypiA-B-Zero</strong></li>
<li><strong>raspberrypi2</strong></li>
<li><strong>raspberrypi3-4</strong></li>
<li><strong>SPARC</strong></li>
<li><strong>MIPS</strong></li>
<li><strong>C</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also configure your compiler by replacing CC by your compiler's name (by default nut uses clang):
<code>bash
$ make CC=gcc
</code></p>

<p>your output directory:
<code>bash
$ make OUTPUT=bin
</code></p>

<p>your assembler:
<code>bash
$ make ASSEMBLER=as
</code></p>

<p>and more...</p>

<p>When you finish compiling, your binaries will be in the bin directory. If you want to build the complete nut environment (boot files, kernel, boot scripts and more...) you can run this command instead:
<code>bash
$ make release
</code></p>

<p>you will see a new directory called release, there will be your binaries, and also a <em>.zip</em> file called <em>nut.YOUR-ARCH.zip</em>, there will be the nut environment.</p>
