<h1>The stack programming language</h1>

<p>Stack is a small, fast and lightweight programming language that allows the C/C++ control and the JAVA ergonomy. Stack compiles into C code, but this process is automatized by the stack compiler, wich outputs an executable file (<em>.exe</em>, <em>.app</em>, <em>.out</em>...).</p>

<h3>Getting stack</h3>

<p>If you want to get the stack compiler and API, you have 2 options, get the binaries or an installer in the releases page or build it from the source code, but if you want to build it from the source code you need to have GCC, GNU Make and Rust (with cargo) installed.</p>

<h4>Binary releases</h4>

<p>In this step you have to between a <em>.zip</em> file, a script installer (<em>.sh</em>, <em>.bat</em>) or a <em>.exe</em> installer.</p>

<h5><em>.zip</em> file</h5>

<p>First, go to the <a href="https://github.com/HdbSoft/stack/releases">releases page</a> and go to the latest version release, then get the <em>.zip</em> file and uncompress it, place the compiler files in the <strong>/bin</strong> folder if you are on macOS or LINUX, or in <strong>C:\WINDOWS</strong> if you are on Windows. Then place the API files in the <strong>$HOME/stack</strong> folder and you will have done. Finally, run this command:
<code>bash
$ stack -h
</code>
and it should output some text.</p>

<h5>Script installer</h5>

<p>First, go to the <a href="https://github.com/HdbSoft/stack/releases">releases page</a> and go to the latest version release, then get the <em>.sh</em> file if you are on UNIX or the <em>.bat</em> file if you are on Windows. Then run it by the following command:</p>

<h6>Windows</h6>

<p>```batch
C:> .\stack.win.bat
: Normal instalation</p>

<p>C:> .\stack.win.bat source
: From the source code instalation
```</p>

<h6>UNIX</h6>

<p>```bash
$ ./stack.unix.sh</p>

<h1>Normal instalation</h1>

<p>$ ./stack.unix.sh source</p>

<h1>From the source code instalation</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Finally run the following command:
<code>bash
stack -h
</code></p>

<p>and it should output some text.</p>

<h5><em>.exe</em> installer</h5>

<p>As in the previous steps, you have to go to the <a href="https://github.com/HdbSoft/stack/releases">releases page</a> and then to the latest release, next you have to click on the <em>.exe</em> file and save it, after that you have to run it and it will be installed in your device.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> The <em>.exe</em> file is only for Windows, not for macOS or Linux.</p>

<h4>Building it from source</h4>

<p>If you want to build stack from source, you have to get the first thing you need to do is to clone the source code:
<code>bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HdbSoft/stack.git stack
$ cd stack
</code>
and then use make to build and install it:
<code>bash
$ make install
</code></p>

<h3>The stack API</h3>

<p>The stack API contains some features which could be used in your program. Here you have the modules list:
- <strong>bintree:</strong> Binary trees library
- <strong>binary:</strong> Bits and bit vectors library
- <strong>colors:</strong> Console colors library
- <strong>cli:</strong> Build great CLIs with this library
- <strong>embed:</strong> Embedded programming library
- <strong>keyboard:</strong> Keyboard detection library
- <strong>maths:</strong> Maths constants and functions
- <strong>registry:</strong> CPU registers library
- <strong>rng:</strong> Random number generation library</p>

<p>You can import them by using the <code>import</code> macro:
<code>c
import std
import structs
import binary
import colors
import cli
import embed
import keyboard
import maths
import registry
import rng
</code></p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>In this paragraph you can see some stack examples:</p>

<h4>Hello, World!</h4>

<p><code>c
main does
    WriteStringln("Hello, World!");
    end;
fi
</code></p>

<h4>Random number generation</h4>

<p>```c
import rng</p>

<p>main does
    int n = randnum();</p>

<pre><code>WriteIntln(n);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>fi
```</p>

<h4>Binary tree</h4>

<p>```c
import structs</p>

<p>main does
    bnode* root = new_bnode(1);</p>

<pre><code>root-&gt;left  = new_bnode(0);
root-&gt;right = new_bnode(2);

WriteIntln(root-&gt;data);
WriteIntln(root-&gt;left-&gt;data);
WriteIntln(root-&gt;right-&gt;data);

end;
</code></pre>

<p>fi
```</p>

<h4>Binary encoding</h4>

<p>```c
import binary</p>

<p>main does
    bitvec b = encode(14);
    WriteBitVector(b);</p>

<pre><code>end;
</code></pre>

<p>fi
```</p>

<h4>CPU registers</h4>

<p>```c
import registry</p>

<p>main does
    reg CU = new_reg(12);
    WriteIntln(CU);</p>

<pre><code>end;
</code></pre>

<p>fi
```</p>

<h4>Console colors</h4>

<p>```c
import colors</p>

<p>main does
    FORE<em>COLOR</em>GREEN;</p>

<pre><code>WriteStringln("Hello, World!");
end;
</code></pre>

<p>fi
```</p>
